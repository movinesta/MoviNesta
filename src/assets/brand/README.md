# MoviNesta Brand Assets

This folder contains front-end friendly brand assets used by the MoviNesta shell:

- `movinesta-logo-mark.svg` — square logo glyph used for app chrome and potential favicons.
- `movinesta-logo-neon.png` — neon gradient logo mark (circle + play glyph) for hero areas, splash screens, and marketing-style placements.

When adding new assets, prefer SVG where possible and keep names kebab-cased (e.g. `movinesta-logo-wordmark.svg`). For raster assets (PNGs) like the neon mark, export at 2×/3× resolutions when targeting specific device sizes.
